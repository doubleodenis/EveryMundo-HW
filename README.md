Using JS and React to create a small webpage for displaying flight info.

Steps:
    Clone the repository or download the zip file into a directory.
    
    Go into the root folder of the project (should be everymundohw) using the command prompt/terminal.
    
    Assuming you have Node installed run the command: `npm install`.
    
    Once this finishes running, you should be able to run the command: `npm start`.
    This should start up the web server.
    
    Once the server finishes loading go to your localhost URL (usually localhost:3000/) to view the webpage :)
